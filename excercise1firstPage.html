    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Netball</h2>
    <p><strong>I like netball</strong> because it keeps me active as I am not a person who goes to the gym and works out.</p>
    <p><em>Netball gives me a sense of healthy living</em> because I can keep my body active.</p>

    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p><em>Writing gives me a sense of freedom</em> where I write my thoughts without judgments.</p>
    <p><em>Writing gives me a sense of Purpose</em> I live my truth.</p>
<!--  I made every heading H1 and sub headings h2-->

    <h2>Software Developer</h2>
    <p>I want to be able to create systems that help us improve and excel in our day-to-day responsibilities.</p>

    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p><strong>I want to create robots</strong> to assist the paralyzed and disabled. I aim to develop systematic robots that can help them bathe themselves independently and perform their day-to-day duties without the fear of failure.</p>
